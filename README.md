# F5XC-SSL-Compatibility

As I'm working with different clients during PoV engagement or post sales support there can be a challenge with Health Checks and TLS Ciphers. Troubleshooting both at the same time can be a little challenging. 

What I'd like to have is a way to determine the highest TLS value (High, Medium, or Low) that will work with the origin server. 

I have a github repo where I've built xctlsratings.csv which is based on the public documentation found here: https://docs.cloud.f5.com/docs/reference/tls-reference
